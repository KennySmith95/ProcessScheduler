My part 1, 2, and 3 compile with no errors, and no warnings, also has no memory leaks or errors. Part 4 isn't consistent with memory errors, it sometimes has 8000 memory errors and sometimes doesn't. Part 4 is leak free too tho. I didn't have time format my elapsed time but everything else works. Also my environment variables work sometimes and other times do not. It worked originally and then all of a sudden it didn't. I'm assuming it has to do with my virtual machine because when i restarted my virtual machine it worked again. So I don't really know what it may be.
